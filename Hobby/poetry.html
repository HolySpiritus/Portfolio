        <h3>Path of Hope (newest) </h3>
        <p>I wanted to escape forever,<br>
            But these loud noises pull me back, however.<br>
            I see countless people every day,<br>
            And feel like I'm always in their way.<br>
            <br>
            I came to a forest seeking peace,<br>
            But found much more than mere release.<br>
            The sky was clearer than before,<br>
            And mountains stretched forevermore.<br>
            <br>
            Happy animals crossed my path,<br>
            Following them, I forgot my past.<br>
            A sense of endless calm arose,<br>
            And in my heart, belief reposed.<br>
            <br>
            I watched the birds twirl as they sang,<br>
            Their melody left me in awe, still rang.<br>
            I remembered love I used to hold,<br>
            Yet never cherished, never told.<br>
            <br>
            "I forgive myself," I softly swore,<br>
            "I want to find hope once more."<br></p>

        <h3>Breathe.</h3>
        <p>I wake up and I breathe,<br>  
            For there's another journey indeed. <br> 
            I grab my stuff and always leave,<br>  
            For my life is filled with grief.<br>
            <br>
            I stand up and I breathe,<br>
            Though my hands now bleed.<br>
            I wish to end this grief,<br> 
            And find eternal peace.<br>  
            <br>
            I walk and I breathe,<br>  
            Faces sadder than they seem.<br>  
            They wish to shed a tear,<br>  
            But feel there's no need.<br>  
            <br>
            I looked at her, couldn't breathe,<br>  
            She held my wounds, stopping the bleed.<br>  
            She took my tears in need,<br>  
            Showing my life was worth indeed.<br>  
            <br>
            She took my hand and guided me,<br>  
            To a night forest, a sight unseen.<br>  
            Beauty strung in every tree,<br>  
            I finally felt a peaceful weave.<br>  
            <br>
            I was proud to breathe,<br>  
            For I had ended my grief.<br></p>
