    <h2>Founder</h2>
    <p>The founder of Steam, Gabe Newell, is a visionary in the gaming industry who has left an indelible mark on gaming culture. With a background that includes working at Microsoft and helping to develop iconic games like Half-Life, Gabe's passion for gaming and technology is evident in everything he does. He founded Valve Corporation, the company behind Steam, with the belief that there was a better way to distribute and play games. Under his leadership, Steam revolutionized the way games are bought, downloaded, and played, introducing features like automatic updates, community forums, and a vast digital storefront. Gabe's commitment to innovation, coupled with his deep understanding of both gamers' needs and developers' challenges, has made Steam the powerhouse it is today.
