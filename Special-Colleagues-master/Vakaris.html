    You spent some time in the stage coach with Vakaris and had small conversations to find out about him<br>
    <br>
    He's pretty interesting he mainly hangs out with one person mainly so he would more then us.<br>
    <br>
    His hobbies: Playing games sometimes, By our thoughts he definitley listens to music and watches movies.<br>
    <br>
    How he met Sniper? Well Sniper dosen't know much about him either just like Ratt they met in school just never really induldge into many conversations<br>
    <br>
    Like we said he mainly hangouts with Danielius you would mostly see either one of them or both it was rare to not see either at least to us<br>
    <br>
    That's pretty much all we couldn't get much info Through the short ride but at least we know about him now<br>
