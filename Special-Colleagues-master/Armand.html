    You two spent a year trading and dealing with Armandas<br>
    <br>
    You ended up realizing that trading is pretty interesting, Armandas may have been doing this longer then you but you enjoyed buying and reseling stuff. I mean who doesn't love money right?<br>
    <br>
    He studies in the same place like Sniper its called KITM. They both study front and back end java script programming and their teacher is Robertas.<br>
    <br>
    Sadly we couldn't find out much on that but we know mainly about his trading, but shockingly he doesn't watch anime nor does he read manga.<br>
    <br>
    Well he either mostly programs probably or he plays some video games I think by the theme u can tell he likes TF2 pretty much<br>
