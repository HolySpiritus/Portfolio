    Over the time you have leanrt some things about Ratt and genuinley find out why is she one of Snipers best friends.<br>
    <br>
    Ratt is cool like super cool, she's maybe crazy for being a ratt. But in the end she's a trustful friend and you genuinley had fun with them.<br>
    <br>
    Her hobbies: Drawing, playing games sometimes, ofc she listens to music and ofc glazes hot men from one piece.... Kinda gay.<br>
    <br>
    She's highly talented and ofc you can't hate a person with good talent.<br>
    <br>
    How she met Sniper? almost gassed her because he thought he had a Rat in the house but instead it was just Ratt (He met her in school)<br>
    <br>
    Besides Sniper she has another friend called Gabs, Gabs also knows Sniper because he calls her a midget but cares for her a lot also she's born on August 31<br>
    <br>
    That's pretty much all you see her birthday bellow and well shit I think u really enjoyed spending time with those two.<br>
    <br>
    Initial release date: April 7th 2006<br>
